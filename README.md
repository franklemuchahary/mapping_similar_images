# Learning Data Visualization

All things related to learning the art of telling stories through data using visualizations created in R and Python.
Creating visualizations for performing exploratory data analysis on a few popular and openly available datasets like the `tips dataset`, `auto-mpg dataset`, and `life_expectancy dataset`. Will be working on adding more interactive visualizations.
